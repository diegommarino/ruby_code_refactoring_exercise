# Code refactoring exercise

Before start refactoring the code I built all the tests for it, so I could garantee
that I would not change the original functions output.

## Running the tests

To run the tests you need to have bundle gem installed. After that execute

``` console
$ bundle install
$ rake tests
```

To run the tests for the initial code use
``` console
$ rake original
```
