# Code refactoring exercise

The code that was refactored was the [car_rental_initial.rb](https://github.com/diegommarino/ruby_code_refactoring_exercise/blob/master/car_rental_initial.rb) file. The refactored code is the [car_rental.rb](https://github.com/diegommarino/ruby_code_refactoring_exercise/blob/master/car_rental.rb).

Before start refactoring the code I built all the tests for the initial file, so I could garantee
that I would not change the original functions output, or the codes would break.

## Running the tests

To run the tests you need to have bundle gem installed. After that execute

``` console
$ bundle install
$ rake tests
```

To run the tests for the initial code use
``` console
$ rake original
```
